# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a GitHub profile repository for Rosa Mordasiewicz. The repository contains:
- A professional resume/CV in the main README.md file
- A profile directory with a placeholder README.md 

## Repository Structure

```
.github/
├── README.md          # Professional resume/CV content
├── profile/
│   └── README.md     # GitHub profile display (currently placeholder "foo")
```

## Purpose and Context

This repository serves as:
1. A version-controlled professional resume/CV
2. A GitHub profile repository (the profile/README.md file will be displayed on the user's GitHub profile page)

## Key Guidelines

When working with this repository:
- The main README.md contains professional information and should be treated with appropriate care
- The profile/README.md is what displays on the GitHub profile page and likely needs to be updated from its current placeholder state
- Any updates should maintain professional tone and formatting
- Consider GitHub markdown rendering when making formatting changes

## Common Tasks

- **Update resume content**: Edit the main README.md file
- **Update GitHub profile display**: Edit profile/README.md (this is what shows on github.com/rosamordasiewicz)
- **Preview changes**: Use GitHub's markdown preview or push changes to see how they render on the profile

## Notes

The profile/README.md file currently only contains "foo" and likely needs to be properly configured to display relevant professional information or a welcome message on the GitHub profile page.
